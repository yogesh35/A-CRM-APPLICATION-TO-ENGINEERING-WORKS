# A CRM APPLICATION TO ENGINEERING WORKS

#Project Description:

    An application is required to efficiently manage client information for engineering projects, encompassing details such as company information, owner details, contact information, worker details, and their respective requirements for materials, including measurements. Additionally, the application should automatically calculate the price based on the specified materials and measurements. The available works in Engineering Works comprise Fabrication, Shed Construction, and Pipe Lining. Within the Fabrication work, various processes are involved, namely Drilling, Welding, Cutting, and Folding. Similarly, the shed-work involves the construction of the sheds, and Pipe Lining involves pipe repairing and replacing. These processes are integral to the fabrication workflow and need to be accurately tracked and managed within the application.
